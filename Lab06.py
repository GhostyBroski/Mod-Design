# 1. Name:
#      Ash Jones
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 06 : Sudoku Draft
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program is meant to allow the user to interact with a Sudoku board, making moves regardless of if they are correct or not. This may not be a fully working version of Sudoku, but it does let you save a file and interact with a file.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The hardest part for me, was remembering the logic I've user previously to make the board, such as the logic that scans the box for whether a number is present or not in the rows and columns there. That being said, I finally figured out a solution that makes sense when trying to account for the 9 spaces, filled or not, that make up each box. Beyond that, the rest of the left over difficulty was present in which case do I account for first, when verifying if a number is legal to be put in a spot or not.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      I accidentally already did it by last week's assignment. It took the same time, being 2 hrs and 15 mins back then.
